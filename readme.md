Feyenoord Ticket Booking Automation
===================================

Welcome to the **Feyenoord Ticket Booking Automation** project! This Python-based tool automates the process of monitoring and booking tickets for Feyenoord matches, specifically targeting events like "Willem II - Feyenoord." It leverages advanced web scraping and automation techniques to streamline ticket purchasing, saving time and ensuring efficiency for users.

üöÄ Project Overview
-------------------

This script automates the entire ticket booking workflow on the Feyenoord ticket platform, from logging in to selecting and reserving seats. It combines API monitoring with browser automation to detect ticket availability in real-time and secure tickets as soon as they're available. Designed for reliability and speed, it's a powerful example of how Python can solve real-world challenges.

### Key Features

-   **Real-Time Event Monitoring**: Polls the Feyenoord API to detect ticket availability for specific matches, ensuring you never miss an opportunity.
-   **Automated Login**: Simulates human-like input to securely log into the ticket platform.
-   **Dynamic Seat Selection**: Automatically navigates the stadium map, selects available seats, and completes the booking process.
-   **CAPTCHA Handling**: Integrates advanced techniques to manage Cloudflare, reCAPTCHA, or hCaptcha challenges.
-   **Flexible Output**: Provides detailed logs and status updates for seamless monitoring.
-   **Error Resilience**: Handles network issues, login failures, and sold-out tickets with graceful retries and fallback options.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
---------------------

-   **Python Libraries**:
    -   `Selenium`: For browser automation and dynamic page interaction.
    -   `Requests`: For API calls to fetch real-time event data.
    -   `WebDriverWait` & `Expected Conditions`: For robust element detection and timing.
-   **Techniques**:
    -   API reverse engineering to extract authorization tokens.
    -   Headless browser automation for seamless navigation.
    -   Randomized input delays to mimic human behavior.

üéØ How It Works
---------------

1.  **Login Automation**: The script logs into the Feyenoord ticket platform using provided credentials.
2.  **API Monitoring**: Continuously checks the Feyenoord API for event availability (e.g., "Willem II - Feyenoord").
3.  **Token Extraction**: Captures authorization tokens from network logs for secure API access.
4.  **Ticket Detection**: Scans the website and API for target events, triggering booking when found.
5.  **Seat Booking**: Navigates the stadium map, selects a seat, and completes the purchase process within the platform's time limit.
6.  **Status Updates**: Logs progress and alerts users to confirm payment within the 20-minute cart reservation window.

üìã Setup Instructions
---------------------

1.  **Install Dependencies**:

    ```
    pip install selenium requests

    ```

2.  **Set Up ChromeDriver**:
    -   Download [ChromeDriver](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/chromedriver/downloads) matching your Chrome version.
    -   Update the script with the path to `chromedriver.exe`.
  
3.  **Run the Script**:

    ```
    python main.py

    ```

    *Note*: Update the script with your credentials and target event details before running.

üåü Why This Project Stands Out
------------------------------

-   **Efficiency**: Automates a time-sensitive process, reducing manual effort.
-   **Reliability**: Handles edge cases like login failures, sold-out tickets, and CAPTCHAs.
-   **Scalability**: Easily adaptable for other ticket platforms or events with minor tweaks.
-   **Showcase of Expertise**: Highlights proficiency in Python, Selenium, API integration, and error handling.
